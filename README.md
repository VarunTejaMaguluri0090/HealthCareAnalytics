# Health-Care-Analytics

=======
This project was bootstrapped with

The main goal of this project is to develop a data-driven solution for predicting heart problems in individuals with the aim of improving the accuracy and efficiency of health prediction. Existing healthcare systems rely heavily on the expertise of healthcare professionals, which can be limited by available information and extensive experience. To overcome these limitations,the project will use data mining techniques and algorithms.<br />
The system is designed to be easy to use and requires only a few common inputs to create forecasts. This project uses the Statlog (Heart) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository as a source of truth for training the system. The dataset contains various attributes such as age, gender, type of chest pain, cholesterol, sugar, and score that can be used to train the system and predict heart problems. The significance of this project is that it has the potential to transform the healthcare industry by reducing reliance on medical professionals and providing more accurate and efficient health predictions. The system can detect potential health problems early, so individuals can take proactive steps to improve their health and reduce their risk of heart disease.<br />
Finally, the project rationale emphasizes the importance of providing accurate and efficient health predictions for people with heart problems. This project aims to improve the health system's reliance on assumptions and increase the accuracy and efficiency of health prediction by using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Deployment, Operations, Maintenance

Frontend Deployment Platform (Netlify):
Deployment: Use Netlify for automatic deployment of React and Node.js applications via Git integration.
Operations: Leverage Netlify's scalability and monitoring tools for optimal front- end performance.
Maintenance: Regularly update the front-end codebase, ensuring compatibility and efficiency.

Backend Deployment Platform (Replit):
Deployment: Host Python and Flask backend on Replit, facilitating deployment via project sharing or exporting as a web service.
Operations: Monitor server logs, explore resource scaling options, and maintain code updates for smooth backend operation.
Maintenance: Update backend code regularly, test changes, and use version control for code management.

Database (AWS RDS and SQL Workbench):
Deployment: Set up the database on AWS RDS, connect it to the Flask backend, and use SQL Workbench for development.
Operations: Monitor AWS RDS metrics, schedule backups, and ensure security settings are up-to-date.
Maintenance: Execute database schema updates through SQL Workbench, maintain security, and document deployment processes.
